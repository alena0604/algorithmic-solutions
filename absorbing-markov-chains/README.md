## Solution

To find the probability to reach absorption states we need several components

Q - matrix of transition -> transition
R - transition -> terminal
0 - terminal -> transition
I - terminal -> terminal

Given matrix with weights

Calculate probability matrix for this we need to weights / sum(weights)

Separate states. We have transitional and absorbing states
